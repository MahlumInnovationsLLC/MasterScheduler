You are building a full-featured Quality Assurance Module to be added to our app. This module will ensure traceability, compliance, corrective actions, audit controls, document integrity, and training accountability across all vehicle projects. It must tightly integrate with the rest of the app (including Projects, Manufacturing, Scheduling, and Reporting modules).

🧱 Module Name: Quality Assurance Center
Each of the following sub-modules must work independently but remain cross-linked through shared Project Numbers, Bays, User Roles, and Document References.

Date Identified

Identified By (user)

Part/Subsystem Involved

Severity Level (Low/Med/High/Critical)

Attach images/documents

Status (Open, Under Review, Resolved)

Include auto-tagging to initiate CAPA if severity is above Medium

2. 🔁 Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA)
Triggered by NCR, Audit Findings, or manually

Fields:

Linked NCR or Audit Finding

Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys, Fishbone options)

Corrective Actions Taken

Preventive Measures Instituted

Owner (Responsible Party)

Due Date

Effectiveness Review Date

Status (Draft, In Progress, Complete)

Exportable CAPA Summary PDF

3. 📦 Supplier Corrective Action Requests (SCAR)
Issued to suppliers for quality defects or late deliveries

SCAR Fields:

Supplier Name

Linked PO or Part Number

Description of Defect or Issue

Date Reported

Supplier Response Required By

Attach evidence or photos

Fields for Supplier Response (within portal or email link)

Calendar View for Scheduled Audits

PDF Export of Full Audit Report

5. 📁 Document Control
Upload, version, and manage quality documents:

SOPs, Work Instructions, Forms, Calibration Records

Features:

Tag by Department, Project Type, or Compliance Category

Version Control (with comments and changelog)

Approval Workflow (Draft > Submitted > Reviewed > Approved)

Expiry Notifications & Revalidation Tracker

Only Admins/QC Managers can publish

Users can “Acknowledge” documents to verify reading

6. 🧠 Training Center
Assign training modules or documents to users

Types of Training:

Onboarding (Safety, QMS Overview)

Equipment Certification

SOP Familiarity

Features:

Upload Training Content (PDFs, videos, slides)

Quiz Capability (Multiple Choice, Score Threshold)

Completion Tracker

Recertification Date Management

Reporting per user, per department

🔗 Integration with Existing App
Project Linkage: Every NCR, CAPA, Audit, or Training record can be linked to a Project Number

User Roles:

QA Manager: Full Access

Project Leads: Can create/view NCRs, initiate CAPAs

Operators: Can log NCRs, acknowledge documents, take training

Manufacturing Integration: NCRs can be launched from Bay or Station screen

Meetings Module: NCRs and CAPAs can be pulled into Meeting Reports

Dashboard Widgets:

Open NCRs by Project

CAPA Status Tracker

Overdue SCARs

Audit Readiness Score

Document Expiration Alerts

Training Completion Rate by Team

📄 Reports & Exports
All sections should support:

PDF and Word Exports

Filter/Sort by Project, Date, Status, etc.

Dashboard Summary Printouts

Auto-numbering format (e.g., NCR-2025-001)

💾 Database Structure
Use Neon DB or Replit DB with tables:

ncrs, capas, scars, audits, documents, trainings, acknowledgements, users

Ensure foreign key linking via project_id, user_id, document_id

🛠 Optional Enhancements
Digital Signatures (for Approvals)

Email Notifications & Daily Digest

AI Assistant to Suggest Root Causes based on past data

Mobile-responsive interface for shop floor use

Let me know if you'd like this converted into a downloadable implementation plan or added to a Word document for SOP use.
